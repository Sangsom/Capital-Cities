# Capital-Cities

App is created by following Hacking by Swift book by Paul Hudson.

As an challenge exercises I've implemented following features:

- Try typecasting the return value from `dequeueReusableAnnotationView()` so that it's an `MKPinAnnotationView`. And change it's `pinTintColor` property.
- Add a `UIAlertController` that lets users specify how they want to view the map.
- Modify the callout button so that pressing it shows a new view controller with a web view, taking users to the Wikipedia entry for that city.
